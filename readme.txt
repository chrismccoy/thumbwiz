Thumbnail Wiz

This plugin will allow you to generate thumbnails for uploaded videos right in the browser without needing to install ffmpeg on your web server.

Multiple Options are available.

1. You can have the plugin select the first frame of the video
2. You can have the plugin generate a specific number of thumbnails (default is 4) and you can then select which one to use
3. You can have the plugin generate a random thumbnail
4. You can play the video and use the Select Frame Option.

Bonus:

You also have the option to use the thumbnail as your featured image, incase you use that in your theme, which most themes do.

All Thumbnails will stay intact even if the plugin is disabled.
